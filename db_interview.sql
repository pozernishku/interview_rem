-- (Bonus question)
-- 2.4	Aviv has a bug in the loading process, and notices that the sales table contains 
-- transactions for non-existing vegetables and non-existing customers. 
-- The total sales amount, however, is correct. 
-- How can he solve this issue without losing sales data?

-- We can use left join with sales table to not lose sales data:
select * 
, count(*) over() cnt

from sales s

left join products p on s.product_id = p.id
left join customers c on s.customer_id = c.id
